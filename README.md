# Impact-of-Alcohol-consumption-on-Student-GPA
This project will aim to determine how alcohol consumption influences the GPA of two groups of students taking Math and Portuguese. The target variable will be GPA and the predictors can be workday alcohol consumption and weekend alcohol consumption. Other variables could affect GPA as well, but right now focusing on alcohol consumption.  This project uses methods like linear regression, cluster analysis and other techniques to develop the predictions. Moreover, as the age group in this data set is between 15 to 22, this data set is interesting as being a college student.
